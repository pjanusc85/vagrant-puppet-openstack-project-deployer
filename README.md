# Vagrant Project Deployer Skeleton for OpenStack cluster

Provisioning can be done in multiple ways, puppet is used here. But we should be agnostic and if we like ansible/chef/CFEngine, we should be able to use that.

##Tools Used
* [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [vagrant-openstack](https://github.com/cloudbau/vagrant-openstack-plugin)
* [puppet](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3.7/reference/lang_summary.html)
